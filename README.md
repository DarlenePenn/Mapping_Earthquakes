# Mapping_Earthquakes

## The purpose of this project is to visually identify all the earthquakes in the last 7 days on a multi-layered map that overlays the geographical location of each earthquake, the tectonic plate lines, and the major earthquakes (over 4.5 magnitude). There are 3 different tile layers to choose on the view to make the map interactive, and a legend to explain the color coding of the measurements on the points.  Clicking on a point gives the location and magnitude of that particular earthquake.
